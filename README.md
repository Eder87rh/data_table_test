# Brite Core - data table 

## Deployment method
```
I used github pages because for me is the best and easiest way to run in production a public project with BaaS
```

### How long did you spend on the test? Would you do anything differently if you had more time?
```
It took me around 15 hours or work, if I had more time, probably I would polish the components a litle bit more and I would improve the styles
```

### In what ways would you adapt your component so that it could be used in many different scenarios where a data table is required?

```
I always trying to make the components reusable through named slots, this isn't the exception
```

### What is your favorite CSS property? Why?
```
Flexbox because it makes the elements positioning a breeze, besides I've read about CSS Grid and it sounds very interesting
```

### What is your favorite modern Javascript feature? Why?
```
Async Await for promises, because I feel much easier work with them. Arrow functions is anothe feature I love to use
```

### What is your favorite third-party Vue.js library? Why?
```
vee-validate because the forms validation stop being a problem
```
